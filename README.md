## Why a single repo for multiple mods?

Laziness is the most likely answer.

I will probably regret this decision later on but right now, I prefer convenience to having to manage multiple repos.

Another way to look at it is, if you are going to import files from a github repo, you are probably going to be working on your own edits from loose files. 

This way, all the files you need will be extracted already.
